like telnet server,
to be used on secure environment where no need to put ssh or dropbear
just run it on a linux machind which has /dev/pts (ubuntu 12 and up)

Use a telnet client to connect to the shell.

compile with USE_THREAD in main.h becuase looks like without it
zobies are around.

work in progress...
